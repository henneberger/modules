# Mari Kit

[![CI](https://github.com/MariHQ/mari-kit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MariHQ/mari-kit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Backend-agnostic Python tools for knowledge systems.

Mari Kit turns changing company sources into versioned, permission-aware,
evidence-linked knowledge. The Python distribution is named `mark-kit`, and
Python imports use `mark_kit`.

The package rename is a breaking change: update dependency declarations and all
imports to these names. No legacy import alias is provided. The repository and
documentation URLs are unchanged.

Use it with OpenAI Agents SDK, LangGraph, PydanticAI, or any other agent
runtime. Mark Kit does not implement an agent loop, model client,
database, scheduler, or authorization system.

Mari also does not define a canonical knowledge graph, ontology, construction
pipeline, query planner, or truth policy. Graph algorithms accept caller-owned
IDs and callbacks and return inspectable values without writing storage. An
application or LLM can compose those operations for its particular system.

## What it provides

- Connector and synchronization contracts for polling, streaming hints,
  checkpoints, tombstones, ACL observations, and complete-snapshot reconciliation.
- Structural object and revision references, typed evidence locators, provenance,
  review states, supersession, freshness, retention, and selective invalidation.
- Permission-aware lexical, dense, multi-vector, graph, fusion, reranking, and
  context-selection algorithms with inspectable scores and traces.
- Parsers and validators for documents, facts, decisions, answers, schemas,
  graph candidates, memories, completed agent activity, and learned procedures.
- Reference stores, indexes, serializers, benchmarks, and conformance checks
  that production adapters can replace.

The [documentation](https://kit.mari.guru/) begins with complete paths for
company search, governed knowledge, and knowledge derived from completed agent
work. The feature pages contain the full capability catalog and research basis.
For the shared integration path, start with
[dependency-aware updates](docs/dependency-updates.md) and
[conversation knowledge](docs/conversation-knowledge.md). The
[repository docs index](docs/README.md) separates current guides from historical
design notes and reference audits.

## Installation

The project currently targets Python 3.11 through 3.13.

```bash
python -m pip install 'mark-kit @ git+https://github.com/MariHQ/mari-kit.git'
```

For development:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MariHQ/mari-kit.git
cd mari-kit
python3.11 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev,examples]'
```

NumPy is the only required third-party runtime dependency. The `examples`
extra installs the official OpenAI and Slack Python SDKs. The `openai-agents`
and `langchain` extras install those runtimes alongside Mark Kit; they
do not replace their native agent APIs with Mari wrappers.

## Core model

A connector emits immutable `KnowledgeDocument` revisions. Provider identity
is namespaced through `document_id`, so IDs from different systems cannot
collide.

```python
from mark_kit import DocumentACL, KnowledgeDocument, Principal

document = KnowledgeDocument(
    source_id="github:acme/product",
    external_id="file:docs/refunds.md",
    title="Refund policy",
    body="Enterprise purchases can be refunded within 30 days.",
    revision="8f31c2a",
    source_url="https://github.com/acme/product/blob/main/docs/refunds.md",
    acl=DocumentACL(
        visibility="restricted",
        principals=(Principal(kind="team", identifier="support"),),
    ),
)

assert document.document_id == "github:acme%2Fproduct/file:docs%2Frefunds.md"
assert document.content_digest.startswith("sha256:")
```

`DocumentACL` records what the provider reported. Your application maps those
principals to its users and decides authorization. Mari does not silently turn
provider metadata into an access-control system.

## Synchronization

Connectors yield `PollPage` values. `plan_sync` converts each page into
upserts, deletes, unchanged IDs, and the next durable state without performing
storage writes.

```python
from mark_kit import SyncMode
from mark_kit.sync import SyncState, plan_sync

state = SyncState()

for page in connector_pages:
    plan = plan_sync(
        state,
        page,
        source_id="github:acme/product",
        mode=SyncMode.FULL,
    )

    # Persist these document changes and plan.state atomically.
    persist(
        upserts=plan.upserts,
        deletes=plan.deletes,
        state=plan.state,
        expected_generation=plan.expected_generation,
    )
    state = plan.state
```

Important guarantees:

- Sync state is bound to one source.
- An incomplete full snapshot cannot resume as an incremental sync.
- Deletion by absence occurs only after a complete full snapshot.
- Explicit provider tombstones are accepted in either mode.
- Every plan advances a generation for compare-and-swap persistence.
- Connector metadata cannot bypass content fingerprinting.

`stream_sync` performs the same planning lazily for an iterable of pages.

## Retrieval with MUVERA

Build an immutable index from one or more vectors per document. Search uses
MUVERA and PolarQuant to select candidates, then exact normalized MaxSim to
rank the final results.

```python
import numpy as np

from mark_kit.retrieval import build_index, search_index

index = build_index({
    "docs/refunds": np.asarray([
        [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
        [0.9, 0.1, 0.0],
    ], dtype=np.float32),
    "docs/deployments": np.asarray([
        [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
    ], dtype=np.float32),
})

query = np.asarray([[0.95, 0.05, 0.0]], dtype=np.float32)
hits = search_index(
    index,
    query,
    limit=5,
    allowed_document_ids={"docs/refunds"},
)

assert hits[0].document_id == "docs/refunds"
```

`allowed_document_ids` must come from the host's authorization decision. The
filter is applied before candidate scoring and exact reranking, so restricted
documents cannot appear in the result set.

Indexes can be persisted with `serialize_index` and restored with
`deserialize_index`. The serialized files include checksums and reject unknown,
missing, or corrupted entries.

For weighted reciprocal-rank fusion, diversity-aware packing, graph
propagation, topic segmentation, and memory mutation plans, see
[`docs/research-algorithms.md`](docs/research-algorithms.md).
Ten additional paper-derived retrieval, memory, evidence-reading, and
compression boundaries are documented in
[`docs/ten-paper-extensions.md`](docs/ten-paper-extensions.md).
Contradiction retrieval and within-document self-contradiction detection are
documented separately in
[`docs/contradiction-algorithms.md`](docs/contradiction-algorithms.md).
Their permissively licensed cross-implementation checks and the RRC-DSCD
paper/code discrepancy are recorded in
[`docs/contradiction-reference-validation.md`](docs/contradiction-reference-validation.md).
The original evidence and validation requirements behind the artifact, store,
pipeline, context, temporal-graph, procedure, and compiler APIs are in
the historical [API design rationale](docs/proposed-api-foundations.md).
Use the current feature docs for importable signatures and implementation scope.

## Evidence validation and freshness

The [incremental maintenance algorithms](docs/incremental-maintenance.md) add
selection-aware dependencies, an indexed update frontier, stable split/merge
lineage, and reversible count/vector/lexical/membership aggregates. Run
`python -m examples.quickstarts.knowledge_maintenance` for the complete
message-to-topic-to-search fixture, including clean-rebuild equivalence checks.

Atoms, retrieval units, evidence, and derived artifacts share scoped revision
references and a common dependency-update planner. It tracks exact text,
context, source bindings, collection membership, and caller-supplied policy
versions. Successful materialization receipts allow unchanged outputs to stop
downstream recomputation. See [shared dependency updates](docs/dependency-updates.md)
and the [executable integration](examples/quickstarts/dependency_updates.py).

Mark Kit does not own prompts or model calls. Give your agent the source
documents, then pass its structured output to a parser. The parser verifies
document IDs, exact quotes, character spans, and source revisions.

```python
from mark_kit.knowledge import assess_freshness, parse_answer

model_output = {
    "answer": "Enterprise purchases can be refunded within 30 days.",
    "disposition": "grounded",
    "evidence": [{
        "document_id": document.document_id,
        "quote": "Enterprise purchases can be refunded within 30 days.",
    }],
}

answer = parse_answer(
    "Can an enterprise purchase be refunded?",
    (document,),
    model_output,
)

current = assess_freshness(
    answer.evidence,
    {document.document_id: "8f31c2a"},
)
assert current.reusable

stale = assess_freshness(
    answer.evidence,
    {document.document_id: "a91de77"},
)
assert not stale.reusable
```

Available parsers include `parse_facts`, `parse_claim_assessments`,
`parse_decisions`, `parse_answer`, `parse_answer_candidates`, `parse_glossary`,
`parse_digest`, `parse_impact`, and `parse_refinement`.

See [`docs/knowledge-parsers.md`](docs/knowledge-parsers.md) for the academic
task foundations behind each parser, the exact contract Mari adopts, and the
places where deterministic validation is intentionally narrower than semantic
entailment or the cited benchmark.

Fact extraction and checking tolerate only recoverable model drift. Cosmetic
claim variants are deduplicated with `normalize_claim`; reordered or lightly
paraphrased assessment rows are restored to the caller's original claim order;
missing rows and unverifiable citations become `uncertain` rather than
invalidating sound findings elsewhere in the batch. Bare evidence quotes are
accepted only when they resolve to exactly one supplied document. Structured
fact fields such as atomic claims, subject/relation/object, scopes, validity,
and conditions are preserved in `FactCandidate.qualifiers`.

Applications can make repeated extraction incremental at section granularity:

```python
from mark_kit.knowledge import fact_scan_revisions, pending_fact_sections

pending = pending_fact_sections(
    documents,
    stored_fact_scan_revisions,
    query="retention",
    limit=20,
)
successful = extract_and_persist_review_candidates(pending)
# Commit these checkpoint updates with the candidates when storage permits.
stored_fact_scan_revisions |= fact_scan_revisions(successful)
```

The section revision is a content hash, so unchanged passages remain complete
while an edit creates one new unit of work. Selection is round-robin across
documents. Persist checkpoints only after candidate persistence succeeds,
preferably in the same transaction.

## Verification portfolios

Mari can repeatedly call any candidate-producing function and apply
deterministic, evidence-aware selection. It does not configure or depend on a
model runtime. The result contains the winner plus every score and failed
attempt:

```python
from mark_kit.knowledge import parse_claim_assessments
from mark_kit.verification import best_of_n, score_grounded


def parse_prediction(prediction):
    return parse_claim_assessments(
        (claim,),
        documents,
        {"assessments": prediction.assessments},
    )[0]


result = best_of_n(
    lambda: generate_assessment(claim, documents),
    parse_prediction,
    score_grounded,
    attempts=3,
    threshold=0.9,
)
assessment = result.selected
score = result.selected_attempt.breakdown
assert score is not None and score.evidence_valid
```

The same package exposes `select_best`, `verdict_consensus`,
`idea_completeness`, and `harmonic_score`. Consensus abstains on ties or weak
agreement and only carries evidence from assessments supporting the winning
verdict. Scores are audit signals, not truth probabilities.

Grounding coverage is a reproducible evidence signal, not a model confidence
score and not an automatic approval decision. Review and publishing policy
remain application concerns.

Evidence parsed from Markdown is bound to a stable heading path and section
content hash. Supply current section revisions to avoid invalidating artifacts
for unrelated edits in the same document:

```python
from mark_kit.knowledge import section_revisions

freshness = assess_freshness(
    answer.evidence,
    {current_document.document_id: current_document.revision},
    current_section_revisions=section_revisions((current_document,)),
)
```

If section revisions are omitted, Mari conservatively falls back to the whole
document revision.

## Managed tags

Tags are deliberately separate from connector-owned documents. A new provider
revision therefore cannot erase workspace curation.

```python
from mark_kit.knowledge import (
    TagAssignments,
    TagDefinition,
    assign_tags,
    search_weight,
)

definitions = {
    "canonical": TagDefinition(
        key="canonical",
        label="Canonical",
        kind="canonical",
        search_weight=2.0,
        behaviors=("Wins conflicts",),
    ),
}

assignments = assign_tags(
    TagAssignments(),
    document.document_id,
    definitions,
    add=("canonical",),
)

assert assignments.tags_for(document.document_id) == frozenset({"canonical"})
assert search_weight(document.document_id, assignments, definitions) == 2.0
```

Persist `TagDefinition` and `TagAssignments` in application-owned storage. This
matches Mari Cloud's separate tag-definition and document-assignment model.

## Reviewed intents, speculation, and response caching

A `ReviewedWorkflow` is a human-reviewed intent with known read dependencies.
It is not a general workflow engine. The default policy uses different gates
for safe speculative reads and complete cached responses:

- `speculation_threshold=0.70`
- `cache_threshold=0.97`
- `relevant_document_threshold=0.85`

```python
from mark_kit.trajectories import (
    WorkflowAction,
    WorkflowPolicy,
    decide_reviewed_workflow,
    start_speculative_retrieval,
)

decision = decide_reviewed_workflow(
    query_vectors,
    reviewed_workflow_index,
    current_revisions,
    current_section_revisions=current_section_revisions,
    allowed_document_ids=authorized_document_ids,
    relevant_document_scores=relevant_document_scores,
    impact_decisions=user_reviewed_impact,
    policy=WorkflowPolicy(),
)

if decision.action is WorkflowAction.CACHED_RESPONSE:
    grounded_answer = decision.cached_answer
    response = grounded_answer.answer

elif decision.action is WorkflowAction.SPECULATIVE_RETRIEVAL:
    retrieval_task = start_speculative_retrieval(
        decision,
        retrieve_documents_async,
    )
    # Continue through the host agent runtime and await/cancel the task there.
```

A complete response is reusable only when:

1. The intent clears the high cache threshold.
2. Every recorded document revision is current.
3. No highly relevant new document has unresolved or positive impact.
4. Every dependency document is authorized for the current user.

When a new highly relevant document appears, a user can mark it non-impacting
and preserve reuse. Otherwise Mari selects speculative retrieval and the host
LLM path. Cached responses are `GroundedAnswer` artifacts, retaining exact
evidence, citations, grounding coverage, and non-factual context dependencies
such as a managed styleguide revision.

Impact analysis is not limited to workflows. Give `impacted_artifacts` a
namespaced mapping of answers, facts, digests, or workflows to their exact
dependencies:

```python
from mark_kit.knowledge import impacted_artifacts

impacts = impacted_artifacts(
    {
        "answer:refund-policy": answer.knowledge_dependencies,
        "workflow:support-refund": answer.knowledge_dependencies,
    },
    current_revisions,
    current_section_revisions=current_section_revisions,
)
```

The returned freshness reports identify changed or missing document sections.

## Trajectory analysis

Normalize events emitted by the host agent framework, ask the host model to
label the completed trajectory, and validate that the returned phase ranges
cover the observed events exactly.

```python
from mark_kit.trajectories import parse_trajectory_analysis

analysis = parse_trajectory_analysis(
    normalized_events,
    model_labels,
    family_map={"search_product_knowledge": "inspect", "answer": "answer"},
)
```

The library validates labels and redacts common sensitive arguments. It does
not hide a trajectory prompt or execute an agent.

## Conversations as searchable knowledge

`mark_kit.conversation_knowledge` groups conversations and observable
trajectory content into revision-bound episodes, validates cited knowledge,
and emits summary, question, and topic retrieval facets. Settling windows,
revision caching, and explicit call budgets bound extraction work. Returning
evidence requires current, authorized source events.

See the [integration guide and research references](docs/conversation-knowledge.md)
and [credential-free runnable example](examples/conversation_knowledge_demo.py).
This is a library pipeline: model callbacks, persistence, embeddings, and live
connector integration remain application responsibilities. Semantic extraction
quality has not yet been benchmarked.

## Evidence context

Expand retrieved document sections while preserving source spans, inspect citation
declarations across tools, and plan conversation evidence retention. Optional
Docling JSON mapping and revision-bound asset selection require no additional
runtime dependencies. See [the guide](docs/evidence-context.md) and
[the runnable example](examples/evidence_context_demo.py).

## Connectors

Connector functions accept an injected `HttpTransport`. This keeps network
policy, retries, observability, and testing under application control.

Each catalog provider exposes a configuration value plus validation and batch
polling functions. Providers with event APIs additionally expose verified,
checkpoint-free `ChangeHint` parsing. Events trigger a canonical provider
refetch; they are never treated as complete documents. `stream_pages` can
hydrate hints into `PollPage` values for the same synchronization planner.

See [`docs/connectors.md`](docs/connectors.md) for both contracts, capability
discovery, verification, hydration, and code examples. Executable integrations
are under [`examples/`](examples/).

Credentials are excluded from configuration representations. `HttpRequest`
representations redact authorization headers, bodies, URL userinfo, and common
sensitive query parameters. Applications must still keep raw provider payloads
and tool results out of untrusted logs.

## Executable examples

The integration examples below support deterministic fixture mode and form a
machine-readable acceptance suite. The two additional starting points are
[dependency updates](examples/quickstarts/dependency_updates.py) and
[conversation knowledge](examples/conversation_knowledge_demo.py):

- [`github_pipeline`](examples/github_pipeline/) polls repository knowledge,
  processes a webhook hint, repairs a missed event, reconciles deletion, and
  returns evidence-linked output.
- [`slack_event_pipeline`](examples/slack_event_pipeline/) refetches canonical
  thread state, repairs a missed event, and preserves restricted-channel ACLs.
- [`google_drive_change_stream`](examples/google_drive_change_stream/) applies
  edits and deletions while avoiding re-embedding an ACL-only change.
- [`knowledge_lifecycle`](examples/knowledge_lifecycle/) keeps model prompts in
  the application and validates facts, decisions, glossary terms, FAQs, and a
  digest against exact evidence.
- [`slackbot_reliable_answers`](examples/slackbot_reliable_answers/) uses a
  managed styleguide, real speculative retrieval, one DeepSeek answer round,
  one post-answer analysis round, OpenAI embeddings, conservative caching, and
  revision/new-document impact policies.
- [`cross_user_acl_isolation`](examples/cross_user_acl_isolation/) proves that
  restricted documents are excluded before both MUVERA scoring and reviewed
  cache matching for an unauthorized user.
- [`incident_response_drift`](examples/incident_response_drift/) changes one
  section of a GitHub incident runbook, reports every affected answer, digest,
  and workflow, and preserves the cached escalation guidance grounded in an
  unchanged section.
- [`workflow_view_step_cache`](examples/workflow_view_step_cache/) follows
  [WorkflowView](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.14654) to turn atomic actions into
  detailed phases and a high-level activity, then independently caches the
  evidence-grounded answers discovered inside those phases. It demonstrates
  cross-workflow substep reuse, a tunable cache gate, and selective
  invalidation when one dependency changes.

Run everything without credentials:

```bash
python -m examples.verify_all
python -m examples.conversation_knowledge_demo
pytest -q
```

The Slackbot example can also read real GitHub documents. It posts to Slack
only when `MARI_SLACK_POST=true` is explicitly set. See its
[`README`](examples/slackbot_reliable_answers/README.md) and
[`.env.example`](examples/slackbot_reliable_answers/.env.example).

## Development and release checks

```bash
ruff format --check src tests examples
ruff check src tests examples
pyright src
pytest -q
python -m examples.verify_all
python -m build
```

CI runs those checks on Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 and installs the built wheel
in a clean environment.

## Project status

The API is a pre-release preview. Breaking changes are allowed until the first
stable release and the package is merged back into Mari Cloud. The immediate
integration priorities are transactional sync-state persistence, real
principal-to-document authorization tests, tag-assignment persistence, and
scrubbed fixtures from live connector canaries.

## Independently selectable algorithms

The [algorithm choices catalog](docs/algorithm-choices.md) covers 21 additional
families, with pinned source-project citations and explicit adaptation notes.
Choose lexical variants, subset objectives/optimizers, graph solvers, retrieval
policies, compression, linkage, or memory evolution independently. Models and
storage remain caller choices. Run `python -m examples.algorithm_choices_demo`
from a checkout; optional native solvers use `mark-kit[algorithm-solvers]`.

    Eighty percent measures how much of the candidate text occurs in its exact,

    documents and ten percent rewards multiple citations. Source and citation
    credit saturate at two, so volume cannot manufacture confidence.

    This is lexical evidence coverage, not confidence, model probability, or a
    truth probability. Freshness, authority, review, and contradiction status
    must be evaluated independently.

    can raise it to ``1.0``.

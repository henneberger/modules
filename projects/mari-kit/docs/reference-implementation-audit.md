# Reference implementation and license audit

This is a record of previous inspections, not a live inventory of upstream
licenses or releases. Recheck the exact upstream revision and applicable terms
before redistributing code, weights, or data. See the
[documentation map](README.md) for current API guides.

Mari reimplements small, model-neutral algorithm boundaries. Reference repositories are used for equation, ordering, threshold, and fixture conformance; they are not runtime dependencies.

## Connector references

| Reference | License decision | Mari contribution |
|---|---|---|
| `run-llama/llama_index` | MIT; permissive catalog/reference | Provider coverage audit for cloud stores, Microsoft drives, and RSS |
| `dlt-hub/dlt` | Apache-2.0; permissive reference | SDK-neutral object listing/reading boundary for S3, GCS, and Azure Blob |
| `meltano/sdk` | Apache-2.0; permissive reference | Singer RECORD/STATE interoperability boundary |
| `Unstructured-IO/unstructured` | Apache-2.0; permissive reference | Separation of source ingestion from downstream parsing |

Mari's connector implementations use provider HTTP contracts and independent
normalization code. No upstream connector code or optional SDK dependency is
vendored.

For entries marked inspect-only, Mari is based on the published mathematics and independently written conformance cases. For permissive references, compatible licensing permits comparison, but Mari still keeps independent APIs and tests rather than vendoring the systems.

The first-pass lifecycle additions are clean-room, standard-library implementations. No files from the checked-out repositories are copied into `mark_kit`; the repositories supply observable behavior, data-model comparisons, benchmark adapters, and future conformance fixtures.

The callback-driven graph algorithms were differentially checked against the
shallow NetworkX checkout for weighted shortest paths, connected components,
degree, closeness, betweenness, Jaccard, Adamic--Adar, and SimRank. NetworkX and
RDFLib projection round trips were also executed locally. Mari keeps its own
smaller callback APIs and does not vendor either library.

The composition pass additionally checked Mari's multi-predecessor breadth-first
results against NetworkX predecessor and distance output. BM25 term-frequency
normalization and length normalization were checked against the Apache-2.0
`rank_bm25` implementation after substituting Mari's documented positive IDF;
per-term explanations sum exactly to returned search scores.

The second composition pass inspected Submodlib's cost-sensitive greedy and
marginal-gain interfaces and IntervalTree's half-open overlap behavior. Mari's
implementations remain smaller value/callback algorithms and do not vendor the
libraries or claim their optimized data structures.

The ingestion pass compared Markdown block kinds and line spans with
Markdown-It-Py, HTML heading/table text with html5lib, and Python definition
names plus UTF-8 byte spans with Tree-sitter. The fixtures matched `4/4`, `5/5`,
and `3/3`, respectively. Frictionless and pypdf inform adapter and diagnostic
boundaries; Mari does not claim their complete format coverage.

The trajectory-mining pass ran the checked-out native suites for Plumbline
(`166` tests), AgentHER (`41`), Trace-to-Evals (`68`), Hodoscope (`66`),
TraceRoutine (`168` passed, one skipped), AdaRubric (`98`, with its undeclared
`pytest-asyncio` test dependency supplied), and Rogrep (`144` Rust tests). The
AgentEvals suite attempted LangSmith network tracking and received HTTP 401, so
its native suite is not reported as passing; Mari instead uses local
known-answer path cases. Mari processed Plumbline's seven MIT corpus files as
seven trajectories and 118 events, recovering eight canonical activities and
six exact variants. Independent planted cases recovered 13/13 known invariants,
matched 4/4 path decisions, covered 4/4 embedding clusters, and normalized 3/3
adapter shapes.

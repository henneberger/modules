# Memory segmentation and mutation plans

## Behavior

| Mechanism | Observed behavior | What remains application-owned |
|---|---|---|
| Mem0 mutation plan | 500 LongMemEval evidence replays preserved the latest value. 448 updates | The model that labels add, update, delete, or no-op |
| LightMem segmentation | WikiSection boundary F1 `0.237` with lexical novelty signals | Attention and semantic-similarity models |
| Salience ranking | LongMemEval complete evidence recall@10 `0.906` | Importance and relevance scores |

The replay number validates mutation execution. Mutation classification remains a separate concern. The segmentation score shows that a naive lexical signal is a baseline for production use.

:::{collapse} Example mutation and segmentation examples

| Existing memory | New observation | Planned operation |
|---|---|---|
| No matching fact | New supported preference | Add |
| Older value for same fact | Newer supported value | Update |
| Existing fact explicitly withdrawn | Withdrawal evidence | Delete |
| Same normalized fact and revision | Duplicate observation | No-op |

| Boundary signal | Attention peak | Similarity valley | Split |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Topic transition | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Lexical drift | false | true | false |

`hybrid_topic_segments` splits a stream where an attention-boundary peak and a
semantic-similarity valley agree. The application extracts candidates from
those bounded groups. It classifies each candidate with a memory operation.
`plan_memory_mutations` validates the decisions and returns a storage-free
plan.

## How it works

Normalize boundary and adjacent-similarity arrays to the `n−1` gaps between `n` turns. A gap is eligible when its attention score is a local peak above the configured boundary threshold and its adjacent semantic similarity is below the valley threshold. Eligible gaps split consecutive, non-overlapping segments. Mutation planning then requires exactly one decision per candidate, validates update/delete targets against current IDs, rejects duplicate adds and conflicting operations on one target, and returns a deterministic plan.

from mark_kit.knowledge import (

    plan_memory_mutations,
)

segments = hybrid_topic_segments(turns,

    similarity_threshold=0.40)

plan = plan_memory_mutations(existing, candidates, {
    "new-role": MemoryDecision(operation=MemoryOperation.UPDATE,

store.commit(plan, expected_generation=generation)
```

**Classification remains application-owned.** Mari checks candidate coverage, target existence, add collisions, and conflicting target operations. `apply_memory_mutations` provides a side-effect-free preview. Storage remains the host's responsibility.

The `store.commit` call illustrates a host adapter. Check the expected storage
generation atomically to avoid applying a valid plan to changed memory.
After committing a source revision, submit current stamps to the
[dependency planner](../start/dependency-updates.md) to update embeddings,
evidence bindings, summaries, and retrieval projections consistently. A delete
also changes collection membership, including the transition to an empty set.

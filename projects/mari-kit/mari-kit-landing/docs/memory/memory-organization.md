# Memory organization and evidence notes

## Behavior

| Organization policy | LongMemEval observation | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| Recency + importance + BM25 relevance | Evidence recall@10 `0.953`. Complete recall `0.906` | Relevance dominates under the measured `0.15/0.15/0.70` weights |
| A-MEM link thresholds | Precision `0.436`. Recall `0.944`. F1 `0.597` | Broad linking finds evidence and creates many weak links |
| Chain-of-Note source choice | Gold-judgment component check | Add a measured classifier before making an answer-quality claim |

:::{collapse} Actual LongMemEval retrieval differences

| Question ID | Type | Gold sessions | Gold ranks | Recall-all@5 |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| `e47becba` | Single-session user | 1 | `2` | 1.0 |
| `6d550036` | Multi-session | 4 | `4`, `8`, `>10`, `>10` | 0.0 |

The second case retrieves one supporting session near the top. The complete
evidence set remains missing. `Recall-any` records the early hit, so inspect
`Recall-all` for this failure.

The functions link related notes and rank memories for recall. Another function
decides whether retrieved evidence can support an answer.

## How it works

Note evolution applies a link threshold and a stricter metadata-evolution threshold to caller-supplied similarities. Salience exponentially decays recency, min-max normalizes recency, importance, and relevance over the candidate set, then returns every weighted contribution. Evidence-note decisions validate per-document relevance and answer support before choosing retrieved evidence, explicitly allowed parametric knowledge, or `unknown`.

    MemorySignal(memory_id=m.id, hours_since_access=hours_since(m.last_accessed),
        importance=importance(m), relevance=relevance(query, m)) for m in memories

    EvidenceNote(document_id=n.document_id, relevant=n.relevant,
        supports_answer=n.supports_answer) for n in model_notes
])
```

Authorize the candidate set before ranking or note linking. Min-max
normalization is relative to that set, so adding candidates can change existing
scores. Treat salience as a ranking signal within one query. Similarity-based
links propose related notes. Source agreement and independent corroboration
require separate evidence checks.

For cached note metadata or summaries, declare source membership, source
revisions, and model configuration through the
[shared dependency planner](../start/dependency-updates.md). Preserve exact
evidence bindings even when an unchanged text representation is reusable.

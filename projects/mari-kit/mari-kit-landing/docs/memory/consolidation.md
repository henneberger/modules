# Tiered memory consolidation

## Behavior

| Tier | Keep here when | Promotion signal |
|---|---|---|
| Working | Needed by the active task | Immediate relevance |
| Episodic | A specific event retained for later use | Reuse, outcome, or recency |
| Semantic | A stable fact is supported across evidence | Confidence, recurrence, and review |
| Procedural | A repeatable successful sequence exists | Held-out task improvement |

Consolidation is a budgeted selection policy. Summary generation, importance scoring, and promotion approval remain injected decisions.


:::{collapse} Example budget selection

| Candidate | Utility | Estimated tokens | Selected |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Refund-policy session | 0.91 | 2,400 | Yes |
| Duplicate refund discussion | 0.42 | 2,100 | No |
| Unrelated support session | 0.18 | 1,700 | No |

Tiers are policies over cost and lifecycle. Mari provides topic segmentation and a deterministic promotion planner. The host supplies compression models and commits selected revisions, keeping raw observations available for audit.

## How it works

Filter observations cheaply, group them at attention-peak/similarity-valley topic boundaries, compress within bounded groups, and score promotion from recurrence, recency, usefulness, and evidence diversity. Expensive resolving, superseding, and summarization run in an offline call/token budget. Promotion creates a new artifact revision linked to every contributing observation.

`plan_consolidation` implements the selection step. It normalizes the four
weights, computes a weighted score, then processes candidates by descending
score with artifact ID as the tie-break. A candidate is selected when it meets
the minimum score and fits both remaining estimated budgets. This is a greedy
score-ordered policy. A cost-optimal knapsack solution can select a different
set. Deferred candidates include both low-score and over-budget items.

The plan reserves estimated work. Your executor must enforce actual usage and
handle retries. Represent summaries as derived artifacts with ordered source
membership, revisions, and summarizer configuration so
[dependency-aware updates](../start/dependency-updates.md) can reuse completed
consolidation work after unrelated changes.

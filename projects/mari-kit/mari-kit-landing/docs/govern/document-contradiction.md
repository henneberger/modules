# Document-level self-contradiction detection

## Behavior

| Layer | Mari provides | Caller provides |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment validation | Positive/negative shape rules and sentence bounds | Semantic contradiction judgment |
| Localization | Evidence IDs and overlap accounting | Candidate evidence sentences |
| Reference coverage | Parsed reasoning citations and reward component | Reasoning text |
| Training reward | Separate accuracy, coverage, and format signals | Optimizer and training loop |

ContraDoc model quality comes from the injected judge model. Mari’s validator supplies deterministic semantics around that judgment.

| Observed judge behavior | Result | What it means |
|---|---:|---|
| Contradiction accuracy | `0.694` | The injected judge serves as a baseline. Production use needs further validation |
| Macro-F1 | `0.685` | Positive and negative documents are both represented in the balanced slice |
| Evidence localization recall | `0.388` | Correctly finding the conflicting sentences remains the main weakness |

The reported run uses `deepseek-chat` on a fixed 160-document ContraDoc slice.
Its record names the model alias because an alias can point to different
checkpoints over time.


:::{collapse} Example reward examples

| Expected | Predicted | Evidence hit | Accuracy reward |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Contradiction | Contradiction | Yes | `1 + matched / gold` |
| Contradiction | Contradiction | No | `-1` |
| No contradiction | No contradiction | n/a | `1` |
| No contradiction | Contradiction | n/a | `0` |

**Scope of the contract.** Reference coverage counts sentence tags that appear in reasoning. Mari validates and scores a proposed judgment. The teacher-distilled SFT model, GRPO trainer, and semantic contradiction verifier remain caller components.

[Reinforced Reference Coverage for Document-Level Self-Contradiction Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.67/){.paper}[ContraDoc benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09182){.paper}

[Mari implements sentence-reference parsing, localization invariants, Equation 7 coverage, and Equations 5--8 reward components. These were checked against the MIT RRC-DSCD implementation and Apache-2.0 ContraDoc boundary. The RRC repository's current accuracy code diverges from published Equation 5: it normalizes by predicted evidence and produces a 0.5 zero-hit score. Mari deliberately retains the paper's gold-normalized term and -1 zero-hit result.]{.small}

The module handles one multi-sentence document. It validates the
self-contradiction judgment and locates the conflict. Another field measures
the inspected portion. Reward components feed an external reinforcement-learning
trainer.

## How it works

1.  **Tag sentences.** Number the document from 1 through `n` before inference.
2.  **Propose a judgment.** An injected model returns a Boolean judgment, localized evidence sentence IDs, and reasoning containing `[i]`, `[i-j]`, or `[i]-[j]` references.
3.  **Validate localization.** Mari expands ranges, rejects out-of-document references, requires evidence for positive judgments, and forbids contradiction evidence on negative judgments.
4.  **Measure reference coverage.** Deduplicate every sentence mentioned in reasoning and compute `|S_covered| / |S_total|`.
5.  **Compute independent rewards.** Return accuracy, reference-coverage, and format components for an external GRPO trainer. A correct positive judgment with zero gold-evidence hits receives `-1`. A correct localized judgment receives `1 + matched/gold`.

# Evidence contracts

## Contract

| Claim state | Required evidence behavior |
|---|---|
| Supported | At least one resolvable source span entails the claim |
| Contradicted | At least one resolvable span conflicts with the claim |
| Uncertain | Evidence is missing, malformed, inaccessible, or inconclusive |

Mari validates references against exact document and section revisions. The injected model or evaluator supplies entailment and citation-quality scores.

`ObjectRef` and `RevisionRef` carry scope, namespace, object identity, revision,
and an optional stable unit. `LocatedEvidence` combines that reference with a
typed locator. `ArtifactRef`, `ArtifactEvidence`, and document-specific
`Evidence` remain available during the compatibility migration.

| Locator | Material addressed |
|---|---|
| `TextSpan` | Half-open character range in the exact resolved text |
| `JsonPointer` | Value inside JSON-compatible material |
| `RecordField` | Named field on a stable record |
| `TableCell` | Row and column in a tabular value |
| `PageRegion` | Bounding box on a numbered page |
| `MediaTimeRange` | Time interval in audio or video |

```

The report separates `not_visible`, `unresolved`, `invalid_span`,
`unsupported_locator`, and `quote_mismatch`. Page and media locators accept an
application locator callback. Mari stays independent of the selected PDF or
media runtime. Applications decide whether the evidence is sufficient,
independent, authorized, or persuasive.

## Dependency conversion

`evidence_dependencies` projects each record to `(document_id, document_revision, section_id, section_revision)`, deduplicated by `(document_id, section_id)` and returned in stable order. Two records naming different revisions of the same key raise `ValueError`. Silently choosing one would make reuse nondeterministic.

**Contract boundary.** The record proves that quoted characters occurred in one supplied source revision and records their location. Entailment, source authority, completeness, and truth require claim assessment, corroboration, authorization, and review.

:::


An evidence record is an exact-text quotation bound to the document and section revision supplied to a parser. Offsets count Python string characters. It carries provenance. A model confidence score comes from a separate field.

For [semantic atoms](../ingest/semantic-atoms.md),
`atom.located_evidence(source=source)` retains document-global spans. Resolve
that reference to the full source document revision. A contextual retrieval
prefix belongs to the indexing representation, and citations address the
original source text. Normalization after binding a span requires new
coordinates and an explicit source representation.

## How it works

1.  **Restrict the corpus.** Build an allowed map from the `KnowledgeDocument` values passed by the caller. Reject model citations outside that map.
2.  **Resolve the document.** Require `document_id`. If exactly one allowed document contains the quote, Mari recovers a missing ID. Zero or multiple holders is rejected.
3.  **Match exact text.** Require a non-empty quote and test literal containment in the canonical document body. The contract requires literal text.
4.  **Resolve one section.** Split the document into current sections and find sections containing the quote. A repeated quote spanning multiple sections is rejected unless `section_id` selects exactly one.
5.  **Derive coordinates.** Mari computes `start = section.start + section.body.index(quote)` and `end = start + len(quote)`. Model-supplied offsets and revisions are ignored.
6.  **Bind revisions.** The accepted record receives the current `document.revision`, stable `section_id`, and content-derived `section.revision`. These become the invalidation key.

# Retrieve

## Retrieval paths

Start with [BM25 or dense flat search](retrieval.md) and an explicit allowed
reference set. Add [context packing](context.md) to control budget and expose
selection decisions. Evaluate approximate search or adaptive routing against
that baseline using the same source revisions and query set.

Treat indexes as derived projections of shared source units. The
[dependency planner](../start/dependency-updates.md) coordinates updates to
those projections and preserves reusable atom representations.

| Retrieval shape | Use |
|---|---|
| Lexical BM25 | Exact terminology, identifiers, and code symbols |
| Dense flat | Exact small-corpus baseline |
| HNSW / IVF-PQ | Approximate candidates with measured recall loss |
| MUVERA + MaxSim | Token-level multi-vector candidate generation and exact reranking |
| Atom ANN + parent aggregation | Retrieve stable atoms, rank their section, assemble context at query time |
| SparseCL | Same-topic contradiction candidates |
| Graph propagation | Multi-hop entity-to-passage recall |
| Context lifecycle | Selectively inject evidence before a model call and plan updates afterward |
| [Evidence context](evidence-context.md) | Source expansion, citation declarations, compaction, and multimodal evidence |

| Query | Relevant document | BM25 rank | Approximate-index observation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| SciFact `100` | `4381486` | 1 | Lexical retrieval succeeds immediately |
| SciFact `1099` | `7662206` | 3 | Relevant result follows two distractors |
| SciFact `1` | `31715818` | >100 | Current BM25 misses at evaluation depth |

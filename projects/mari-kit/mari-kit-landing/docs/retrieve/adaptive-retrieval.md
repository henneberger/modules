# Adaptive retrieval and compression

## Behavior

| Mechanism | Mari decides | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| CRAG | Use, supplement, or replace retrieved context from score thresholds | SciFact gold relevance exercised all three routes. The relevance evaluator remains yours |
| FLARE | Retrieval trigger for low-confidence future tokens | QASPER answer novelty exercises masking. Real calibration comes from your model |
| Self-RAG | Candidate utility and whether retrieval is requested | Gold relevance validates score composition. Reflection-token prediction needs a separate measure |
| Chain-of-Note | Retrieved, parametric, or unknown answer source | Gold qrels validate deterministic source choice. Note judgment quality needs a separate measure |
| RECOMP | Which complete sentences fit a token budget | QASPER retained `16.6%` of tokens with evidence recall `0.330` in the measured configuration |

:::{collapse} Example routing examples

| Signal pattern | Decision | Next operation |
|---|---|---|
| High relevance | Accept | Use retrieved corpus evidence |
| Ambiguous relevance | Supplement | Add an external retrieval arm |
| Low relevance | Replace | Discard current candidates and retrieve again |
| Low-confidence future tokens | Retrieve | Mask uncertain tokens and search with the remainder |

Retrieval can be triggered, revised, rescored, or compressed at explicit
decision points across a model call.

## How it works

CRAG routing maps evaluator scores through two thresholds to use the corpus, augment it with external search, or replace it. FLARE finds low-confidence tokens in a predicted future sentence, removes those tokens, and uses the remaining text as a retrieval query before regeneration. Self-RAG combines generation, retrieval, relevance, support, and utility signals with visible weights. RECOMP selects scored sentences under a token budget, then restores their source order.

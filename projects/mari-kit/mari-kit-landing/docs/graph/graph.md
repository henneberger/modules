# Bi-temporal knowledge graph

## Behavior

| LongMemEval temporal check | Result | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| Gold-session provenance visible at question time | `0.936` | Some gold session IDs are absent or timestamp-incompatible in the cleaned records |
| Future-session exclusion | `1.000` | The bitemporal filter excluded every session dated after the question |

The reported value measures visibility semantics. Model answer quality has its
own measure.

:::{collapse} Example bitemporal difference

| Query | Valid at requested time | Known at requested time | Returned |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Historical state before correction arrived | Yes | Yes | Original fact |
| Same valid date, knowledge after correction | Yes | No for original revision | Corrected fact |
| Timestamp equals half-open interval end | No | n/a | Excluded |
:::



`TemporalFact` tracks valid time (when a claim applies) and transaction time (when the system knows it), supporting historical queries and late corrections.

## How it works

An assertion is append-only and carries two intervals. A correction learned
today requires the host to close an older assertion's transaction interval.
`close_transaction` returns a replacement value for that operation. Its historical valid
interval remains in the record. Query `at` filters valid time. Query `known_at`
filters transaction time. Each interval must contain its requested timestamp.
Contradictions create explicit edges or superseding revisions. Prior revisions
stay available.

The temporal functions operate on supplied records. The host persists history
and performs correction writes atomically. Use timezone-aware timestamps and
half-open intervals `[start, end)`. An open end means the interval continues
indefinitely. See [temporal and provenance utilities](temporal-provenance.md)
for joins and shared revision lineage.

**Research basis**[Zep](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956){.paper} uses a
temporally aware graph to maintain historical relationships for agent memory.
The [temporal knowledge-graph survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08236){.paper}
catalogs representations and inference tasks for facts that change over time.
Mari adds explicit valid-time and transaction-time query semantics.
Applications choose interval boundaries and contradiction policies for their
domain.

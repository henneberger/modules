# Graph comparison and quality diagnostics

## Behavior

| Input condition | Diagnostic | Interpretation left to caller |
|---|---|---|
| Edge references absent node | Dangling edge | Reject, repair, or allow external identity |
| Node has degree zero | Orphan | Valid isolated fact or missing relation |
| Several nodes share a fingerprint | Duplicate group | Alias, duplicate, or intentional version |
| Revision changes edges | Structural diff | Expected update or unexpected drift |

## How it works

`graph_diff` compares caller-provided node IDs and hashable edge keys.
`inspect_graph_quality` calculates structural observations. The caller sets
thresholds and acceptance policy.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Inspect two arbitrary graph projections

from mark_kit.graph import graph_diff, inspect_graph_quality

change = graph_diff(
    before_nodes=previous.node_ids,
    before_edges=previous.edge_keys,
    after_nodes=current.node_ids,
    after_edges=current.edge_keys,
)

quality = inspect_graph_quality(
    nodes=current.node_ids,
    edges=current.endpoints,
    fingerprint=lambda node: normalized_identity[node],
)
```

The diff uses exact identity and set semantics. Callers can run entity
resolution before comparison when that is appropriate.

Preserve relation type and edge identity in edge keys when parallel relations
carry different meaning. An endpoints-only key collapses those distinctions.
Use stable scoped object identity to compare the same object across revisions,
then compare its fingerprint to detect content changes.

`diff_records` detects changes that preserve node identity, such as a modified
function body or an updated entity attribute. Identity and fingerprints remain
caller projections.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Separate structural and attribute changes

from mark_kit.graph import diff_records

records = diff_records(
    previous.symbols,
    current.symbols,
    identity=lambda symbol: symbol.qualified_name,
    fingerprint=lambda symbol: (symbol.signature, symbol.body_hash),
)

for change in records.modified:
    schedule_impact_analysis(change.record_id)
```

When a fingerprint says that a record changed, `diff_record_fields` can name
the caller-projected fields responsible for the change.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Explain a stable policy clause revision

from mark_kit.graph import diff_record_fields

changes = diff_record_fields(
    previous.clauses,
    current.clauses,
    identity=lambda clause: clause.clause_id,
    fields={
        "text": lambda clause: clause.text,
        "scope": lambda clause: clause.scope,
        "effective": lambda clause: clause.valid_time,
    },
)
```

## Measures

For derived outputs, pass changed current stamps and collection membership to
the [dependency planner](../start/dependency-updates.md). Structural differences
identify changed topology. Receipts determine whether completed computations
remain reusable after that change.

| Measure | Calculation |
|---|---|
| Node/edge change rate | Symmetric difference divided by union |
| Dangling-edge rate | Edges with missing endpoints divided by edges |
| Orphan rate | Zero-degree nodes divided by nodes |
| Duplicate rate | Nodes in repeated fingerprint groups divided by nodes |
| Construction fidelity | Entity completeness, relation preservation, multiplicity, negation |

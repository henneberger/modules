# Semantic schemas and constraints

## Behavior

| Input | Constraint | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Contract with one customer | Exactly one `customer` relation | Conforms |
| Contract missing an effective date | Required `effective_date` property | Violation at that property |
| `purchased` from Policy to Product | Domain must be Customer | Type violation |

## How it works

`KnowledgeSchema` is an optional validation value alongside Mari's graph model. It describes a small set of concept, property, and relation checks. Validation returns every violation with the focus object and constraint identifier. The caller decides whether that report blocks a write, requests repair, or is ignored.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Define a backend-neutral semantic contract

from mark_kit.schema import (
    ConceptType,
    KnowledgeSchema,
    PropertyConstraint,
    RelationConstraint,
    validate_records,
)

schema = KnowledgeSchema(
    schema_id="commerce",
    version="2",
    concepts=(ConceptType("Customer"), ConceptType("Contract"), ConceptType("Product")),
    properties=(PropertyConstraint(
        "Contract", "effective_date", required=True,
        value_type="string", value_format="date",
    ),),
    relations=(RelationConstraint("purchased", source="Customer", target="Product"),),
    allow_unknown_properties=False,
)

report = validate_records(schema, records)
if not report.conforms:
    for violation in report.violations:
        print(violation.focus_id, violation.constraint_id)
```

## Function definitions and options

| Value / function | Options | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PropertyConstraint` | `required`, `minimum_count`, `maximum_count` | Independent cardinality checks |
| `PropertyConstraint` | `value_type` | Empty, string, integer, number, boolean, object, or array |
| `PropertyConstraint` | `value_format` | Empty, ISO date, or timezone-aware ISO date-time. Formats require strings |
| `KnowledgeSchema` | `allow_unknown_properties` | Defaults true for open-world compatibility. False reports undeclared properties |
| `validate_records` | Schema, records, optional relations | Reports duplicate IDs, concepts, properties, types, cardinality, and relation domain/range |

Boolean values fail integer and number constraints, and non-finite floats fail
number constraints. These are explicit scalar checks. Mari leaves values such as
`"14"` unchanged during validation.

Caller-written adapters can translate this utility to formats such as LinkML
and JSON Schema. SHACL and RDF/OWL integrations can use the same values. SQL DDL or property-graph
constraints need their own mapping. The application controls schema choice,
URI meaning, and its node and edge representation.

Version the schema alongside any extraction or validation recipe that consumes
it. A source revision can stay unchanged as a schema update changes its
validation result. Model that schema version as an explicit dependency in
[dependency-aware updates](../start/dependency-updates.md).

## Measures

| Layer | Measure |
|---|---|
| Constraint engine | Conformance against hand-labeled valid and invalid records |
| Adapter | Round-trip preservation of required/cardinality/domain/range semantics |
| Migration | Violations introduced and records requiring transformation |
| Extraction | Schema-valid precision and recall of proposed entities/relations |

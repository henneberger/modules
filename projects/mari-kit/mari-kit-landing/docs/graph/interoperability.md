# Graph interchange helpers

## Behavior

| Target | Preserved directly | Reported as potential loss |
|---|---|---|
| NetworkX | Node IDs, attributes, edge endpoints and attributes | Backend-specific indexes and transactions |
| GraphML | Scalar attributes and directedness | Nested values, arbitrary Python objects, hyperedges |
| JSON-LD | IDs, types, predicates, JSON literals | Property-graph edge identity unless explicitly reified |
| RDFLib | RDF terms and triples | Reification for parallel identical property edges |
| PyTorch Geometric | Indexed edge tensor | Untensorized application attributes unless mapped by caller |

## How it works

Mari uses a transient `GraphProjection` at the conversion boundary. Application records remain the canonical model. Export functions return bytes or ordinary mappings together with `InterchangeReport`, which lists skipped fields and lossy conversions.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Export a temporary projection and inspect losses

from mark_kit.graph import GraphProjection, ProjectionEdge, to_graphml

projection = GraphProjection(
    nodes=(
        ("customer:42", {"kind": "Customer"}),
        ("product:7", {"kind": "Product"}),
    ),
    edges=(ProjectionEdge(
        source="customer:42", target="product:7", relation="purchased",
    ),),
    directed=True,
)

encoded = to_graphml(projection)
if encoded.report.losses:
    logger.warning("GraphML conversion losses: %s", encoded.report.losses)
write_bytes(encoded.data)
```

Include both endpoints in the node collection before export. Encode scoped references into stable string IDs and preserve the reverse mapping in your adapter. Inspect the loss report before accepting an export. NetworkX, RDFLib, and PyTorch Geometric integrations require their respective optional packages in the host environment.

## Measures

| Invariant | Check |
|---|---|
| Determinism | Same projection produces identical bytes |
| Escaping | IDs and attributes containing XML/JSON metacharacters round-trip |
| Loss visibility | Unsupported nested values produce report entries |
| Optional dependency | NetworkX and RDFLib load when their adapters are used |

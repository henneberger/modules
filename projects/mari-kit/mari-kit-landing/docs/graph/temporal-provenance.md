# Temporal and provenance utilities

## Behavior

| Operation | Inputs | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Interval overlap | Two valid-time intervals | Boolean and intersection |
| Temporal join | Keyed, interval-bearing records | Pairs valid at overlapping times |
| Lineage traversal | Artifact ID and `parents(id)` | Ancestors with depth |
| Taint composition | Input artifact IDs and `taints(id)` | Stable union with source trace |

Use these operations with caller-defined time boundaries, parent relationships,
and source policies. Supply timezone-aware timestamps consistently.

## How it works

Temporal functions treat intervals as half-open `[start, end)`, which gives
adjacent boundaries one interpretation. Provenance functions walk IDs through
caller callbacks and work with caller-owned artifacts. Cycle reports expose
malformed lineage. Visit limits bound traversal.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Join temporal records and explain a derived result

from mark_kit.graph import temporal_join, trace_lineage_edges
from mark_kit.knowledge import Assertion, valid_at

pairs = temporal_join(
    prices,
    contracts,
    left_key=lambda price: price.product_id,
    right_key=lambda contract: contract.product_id,
    left_interval=lambda price: price.validity,
    right_interval=lambda contract: contract.validity,
)

trace = trace_lineage_edges(
    "summary:q3",
    parents=provenance_store.parent_edges,
    max_depth=20,
)

current = valid_at(query_time, interval=lambda assertion: assertion.valid_time)
eligible_assertions = [assertion for assertion in assertions if current(assertion)]
```

`Assertion` binds caller-defined subject, predicate, and value fields to valid
time, transaction time, artifact evidence, and explicit supersession IDs.
`group_assertions` groups by caller semantics. `plan_assertion_update`
implements mechanics after the caller selects `supersede`, `retract`,
`coexist`, or `dispute`. It leaves disposition semantics to the caller.

Metadata-preserving lineage edges retain input role, operation, and arbitrary
parameters during traversal. Plain ID lineage remains available through
`trace_lineage`.

Lineage accepts hashable IDs, including shared `RevisionRef` and `DependencyKey`
values. Reuse those identities across evidence, retrieval, and update planning.
A provenance edge explains an origin. A computational dependency additionally
declares which input facet affects an output. Record the complete input set in
a [derivation specification](../start/dependency-updates.md) to drive refreshes.

`grouped_interval_overlaps` uses a within-group sweep. Each overlapping pair
appears once. Self-pairs are excluded. An overlap is a candidate relationship.
The caller assigns conflict, precedence, and violation semantics.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Find unique effective-time collisions inside caller scopes

from mark_kit.graph import grouped_interval_overlaps

candidates = grouped_interval_overlaps(
    clauses,
    group=lambda clause: (clause.control, clause.jurisdiction),
    interval=lambda clause: clause.valid_time,
)
```

The half-open overlap condition matches the semantics used by interval-tree
implementations: adjacent `[a, b)` and `[b, c)` intervals avoid overlap.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Keep evidence and temporal accuracy as separate measurements

from mark_kit.evaluation import evaluate_graph_context

metrics = evaluate_graph_context(
    selected_nodes=context.nodes,
    evidence_required=gold.evidence_nodes,
    temporally_valid=valid_node_ids,
    edges=context_edges,
)

assert metrics.evidence_coverage == 1.0
print(metrics.temporal_precision)  # measured precision
```

## Measures

| Property | Cases |
|---|---|
| Interval semantics | Adjacent, open-ended, contained, and zero-overlap intervals |
| Temporal join | Multiple overlaps and stable ordering |
| Provenance completeness | Every declared parent reachable in the trace |
| Cycle handling | Cycle reported once, followed by bounded traversal exit |
| Taint conservation | Derived output contains the union of source taints |
| Temporal context | Report evidence coverage and temporal precision separately |

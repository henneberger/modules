# Structural link candidates

## Behavior

For neighborhoods Γ(u) and Γ(v):

| Score | Calculation | Tendency |
|---|---|---|
| Common neighbors | `|Γ(u) ∩ Γ(v)|` | Favors many shared neighbors |
| Jaccard | Intersection divided by union | Normalizes neighborhood size |
| Adamic--Adar | Sum of `1 / log(degree(w))` | Gives rare shared neighbors more weight |
| SimRank | Recursive similarity of incoming neighborhoods | Finds similarity through the wider incoming structure |

## How it works

The functions score candidate pairs supplied by the caller. Edge creation
remains a caller decision. The caller also interprets each score. Direction and
edge types are expressed by the `neighbors` callback. It can apply temporal
filters and authorization before returning adjacent nodes.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Rank application-approved candidate pairs

from mark_kit.graph import score_link_candidates

scores = score_link_candidates(
    candidate_pairs=(("alice", "project-x"), ("alice", "project-y")),
    neighbors=authorized_neighbors,
    method="adamic_adar",
)

for candidate in scores:
    if candidate.score >= review_threshold:
        review_queue.add(candidate)
```

`simrank_scores` is available separately because it scores all pairs in a bounded node set and iterates over incoming-neighbor similarity. It is substantially more expensive than local scores.

Keep candidate endpoints and all returned neighbors inside the authorized
time-sliced graph. Remove held-out links before calculating neighborhoods for
an evaluation. Jaccard and common-neighbor scores depend directly on that
topology, so including the target relation can leak the answer into the score.
Cache scores against graph membership and revision inputs through the
[dependency planner](../start/dependency-updates.md).

## Measures

| Split | Measure |
|---|---|
| Held-out observed links | Hits@k, MRR, ROC-AUC, average precision |
| Time-based split | Future-link precision with a cutoff at evaluation time |
| Candidate generator | Recall before structural scoring |
| Degree slices | Performance for sparse and hub nodes separately |

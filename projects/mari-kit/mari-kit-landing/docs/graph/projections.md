# Event sourcing and disposable projections

## Behavior

| Event sequence | Projection behavior |
|---|---|
| Unique contiguous generations | Ordered replay and event-input build identity |
| Gap or duplicate generation | Reject the build |
| Failed dependency | Use the dependency planner to hold downstream work |

Throughput and atomic pointer swaps belong to the selected backend. Mari defines replay semantics.


:::{collapse} Example replay differences

| Event generations | Result |
|---|---|
| `1, 2, 3` | Projection returned with stable build ID |
| `1, 3` | Rejected: generation gap |
| `1, 2, 2` | Rejected: duplicate generation/event |
:::



Canonical artifacts and append-only events remain authoritative. With a pure
projector and stable initial state, `replay_projection` produces deterministic
derived state. Its build ID fingerprints the ordered events. A backend can
validate and swap that build using its own transaction boundary.

## How it works

Events must have unique IDs and contiguous generations. The replay function folds them in order and hashes the complete event input. Generation gaps and duplicate events fail before a usable build is returned. Storage adapters own staging validation, pointer swaps, and rollback because those guarantees depend on the selected database.

The build ID covers event IDs, generations, kinds, and payloads. Initial state,
projector implementation, and produced output are separate inputs to cache
validity. Record those through a versioned derivation and completed receipt in
the [dependency planner](../start/dependency-updates.md). Keep the projector
side-effect-free because a later invalid event can fail after earlier folds.

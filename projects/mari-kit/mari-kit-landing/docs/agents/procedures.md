# Procedural knowledge

## Measured behavior

| Input evidence | Learned result |
|---|---|
| Repeated successful tool sequences | Stable subsequence from pairwise longest-common-subsequence reduction |
| Arguments identical at every occurrence | Retained arguments |
| Arguments vary between runs | Tool retained with arguments omitted |
| Failed trajectories | Kept as evaluation evidence and excluded from successful-path mining |

Across 60 AgentBench DB tasks, controlled successful traces recovered the
intended two-step sequence. The measurement covers the mining rule. Task
execution and uplift require an agent-level study.


:::{collapse} Mined procedure example

| Run | Tool sequence | Included in learned subsequence |
|---|---|---|
| Success A | `lookup_policy → issue_refund → notify` | First two stable steps |
| Success B | `lookup_policy → issue_refund` | Both steps |
| Failure | `issue_refund → error` | Excluded from positive subsequence |

Learned result: `lookup_policy → issue_refund`.

Successful trajectories produce versioned procedure candidates. Regression
gates check their measured behavior. Human review controls activation.

## How it works

Start with successful traces grouped by a reviewed intent. `learn_procedure`
extracts a parameterized action sequence and retains source links. The caller
adds preconditions and failure exits as domain values. Replay evaluates the
candidate on held-out cases. Its report includes task success, grounding,
cost, tool correctness, and regressions against the active version. A review
proposal can then enter the application's commit path. Failed attempts stay
available as negative evidence.

**Research basis**[Voyager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291){.paper} stores
compositional skills and updates them from execution feedback. Its process also
uses errors and self-verification. [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366){.paper}
retains verbal feedback for later trials. Persistent procedural candidates draw
on these mechanisms. Mari adds held-out regression gates and human promotion
as library policies.

## Function definition and options

`learn_procedure(trajectories, *, intent)` accepts a mapping from caller-owned
trajectory IDs to ordered `TrajectoryStep` sequences. Every input run must be
non-empty and every step must have `ok is True`. Keep failed and unknown
outcomes in separate input records. The function sorts runs by trajectory ID and
reduces their tool sequences through pairwise longest-common-subsequence
comparisons. For three or more runs, this is a deterministic heuristic for a
shared sequence. Arguments are retained when every aligned occurrence
contains the same safe normalized values.

The result contains a procedure ID and revision derived from intent and tool
sequence, the source
trajectory IDs, and immutable `ProcedureStep` values. The returned value is a
candidate. Execution and promotion happen in application code.

The candidate revision excludes retained arguments and source trajectory IDs.
Use a [knowledge artifact](../platform/artifacts.md) with an application-chosen
full-content revision when persisting an approved procedure. Declare source
revisions and the mining recipe in its dependency specification. Review
[promotion gates](procedural-learning.md) before activating the candidate.

# Intent mining

## Measured behavior

| Evaluation | Result | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---|
| Two cosmetic label variants across two runs | One aggregate with support `2` | Default grouping normalizes case, punctuation, and spacing |
| Out-of-range model evidence | `1/1` rejected | An intent cannot cite steps outside its source trajectory |
| Conflicting independent reviews | `1` valid, `1` invalid | The result records both reviews |
| Duplicate reviewer | `1/1` reported | Support counts each reviewer once |
| Two-dimension rubric with required grounding omitted | Aggregate `0.800`, with `1` missing and `1` required failure | The aggregate keeps the absent required dimension explicit |

The checks cover evidence bounds and aggregation. Semantic accuracy depends
on the model and taxonomy chosen by the application. Measure it with a labeled
domain corpus and independent reviewers.

## Represent an inferred intent

An `IntentCandidate` binds a label to one or more inclusive step ranges. Its
`kind` records whether the label was declared, inferred from behavior, or
proposed in hindsight from an unsuccessful run.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Validate intent labels proposed by any model

from mark_kit.trajectories import parse_intent_candidates

candidates = parse_intent_candidates(
    runs,
    {
        "intents": [
            {
                "intent": "Compare retention policies",
                "kind": "inferred",
                "evidence": [
                    {"trajectory_id": "run-17", "start": 2, "end": 6}
                ],
            }
        ]
    },
)
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `intent` | Human-readable proposed intent |
| `kind` | `declared`, `inferred`, or `hindsight` |
| `evidence` | Existing trajectory ID and an inclusive, in-bounds step range |
| `actual_outcome` | What the run achieved. Especially useful for hindsight proposals |
| `limitations` | Gaps between the cited behavior and the proposed intent |
| `candidate_id` | Stable hash of kind, normalized label, and evidence ranges |

## Group intent candidates

`aggregate_intents(candidates, *, key=normalize_intent)` groups proposals and
returns all observed labels, candidate IDs, trajectory IDs, kinds, and support.
Replace `key` with a taxonomy lookup, embedding cluster assignment, or reviewed
mapping owned by the application.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Supply a reviewed grouping

from mark_kit.trajectories import aggregate_intents

groups = aggregate_intents(
    candidates,
    key=lambda label: reviewed_taxonomy[label],
)
```

## Cluster and monitor proposed intents

Before relabeling, applications can group semantically similar proposals with
caller-owned vectors. `cluster_intents` uses cosine-normalized single-link
clustering and returns each cluster's medoid, cohesion, labels, members, and
ambiguous members. `detect_novel_intents` measures each proposal against
caller-owned centroids. `compare_intent_windows` compares reviewed cluster
matches with Jensen–Shannon divergence and explicit new or retired clusters.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Discover intent families from caller-owned vectors

from mark_kit.trajectories import cluster_intents, detect_novel_intents

clustering = cluster_intents(
    candidates,
    embeddings,
    similarity_threshold=0.82,
    ambiguity_margin=0.03,
)
novel = detect_novel_intents(
    new_candidates,
    new_embeddings,
    reviewed_centroids,
    threshold=0.75,
)
```

| Three-label vector example | Cosine relationship | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| “reset password” / “recover login” | `0.9999` | Same cluster at `0.90` |
| “reset password” / “cancel account” | `0.0000` | Separate cluster |

Single-link clustering can bridge distant members through intermediate points.
Cohesion scores and ambiguous IDs expose that behavior. The caller supplies
stable taxonomy IDs when it matches clusters across time.

## Relabel outcomes in hindsight

A hindsight record describes an achieved intent found in a failed run. Set
`kind="hindsight"` and cite the supporting steps. Keep the original run under
its existing identity. A training system can consume the candidate through an
adapter owned by the application.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Summarize independent semantic reviews

from mark_kit.trajectories import IntentReview, summarize_intent_reviews

reviews = summarize_intent_reviews(
    candidates,
    [
        IntentReview(candidate_id=candidate_id, reviewer_id="judge-a", valid=True),
        IntentReview(candidate_id=candidate_id, reviewer_id="judge-b", valid=False),
    ],
)

assert reviews[0].agreement == 0.5
```

`summarize_intent_reviews(candidates, reviews)` deduplicates reviewer identity.
The result reports valid and invalid counts along with duplicates. The caller
sets any acceptance threshold.

For repeated reviews by the same reviewer, the first supplied review wins.
Order review records deliberately and inspect `duplicate_reviewer_ids` before
promotion. Keep stable taxonomy IDs in application storage so a label edit
preserves the intended group identity.

## Task-adaptive evaluation dimensions

An intent label describes the aim inferred from behavior. A rubric carries the
criteria used to judge that behavior. Mari stores each as a separate value.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Generate elsewhere, validate and score here

from mark_kit.trajectories import (
    parse_rubric_assessments,
    parse_trajectory_rubric,
    score_trajectory_rubric,
)

rubric = parse_trajectory_rubric(task, rubric_output)
assessments = parse_rubric_assessments(run, rubric, judge_output)
score = score_trajectory_rubric(
    run,
    rubric,
    assessments,
    required_minimum=0.7,
)

print(score.overall, score.required_failures, score.missing_dimensions)
```

| Function | Options and behavior |
|---|---|
| `parse_trajectory_rubric(task, model_output)` | Requires unique dimensions with positive weights. Preserves `required` dimensions |
| `parse_rubric_assessments(run, rubric, model_output)` | Accepts scores/confidence in `[0,1]`. Validates every evidence-step index |
| `score_trajectory_rubric(..., required_minimum=0.5)` | Confidence-weights repeated assessments. Reports missing and required failures separately from the weighted mean |

The `required_failures` field lists required dimensions below the configured
minimum. A caller can inspect it beside the weighted score before changing
application behavior.

Connect reviewed intent groups to [procedure mining](procedures.md), and use
[conversation knowledge](conversation-knowledge.md) to search the observations
behind a proposed intent. Evidence-bound labels and searchable source content
serve different steps of the same review workflow.

:::{collapse} One scored rubric, as data

| Dimension | Weight | Required | Assessment | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Grounding | `2` | yes | missing | Listed in both `missing_dimensions` and `required_failures` |
| Efficiency | `1` | false | `0.800` at confidence `0.750` | Included in the weighted mean |
| Aggregate | n/a | n/a | n/a | `0.800` over assessed dimensions. Pass status remains caller policy |

# Unified artifact model

## Artifact fields

| Field group | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Identity and revision | Address an immutable artifact version |
| Scope and review state | Control visibility and activation |
| Derivation and evidence | Trace an output back to source revisions |
| Supersession and time | Preserve every historical revision |


:::{collapse} Artifact lineage example

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Artifact ID | `fact:refund-window:enterprise` |
| Revision | `sha256:8f31` |
| Derived from | `github:policy/refunds.md@8f31c2a` |
| Supersedes | `fact:refund-window:enterprise@v2` |
| Review state | `approved` |

`KnowledgeArtifact[T]` gives each knowledge value a shared envelope. Facts and
answers use it. Decisions, summaries, procedures, and graph statements use the
same fields for identity and scope. The envelope also carries provenance,
review state, time bounds, and supersession links.

## How it works

The payload type `T` holds domain content. Its envelope records the controls
around that content. Artifact identity stays stable across immutable revisions.
Evidence links record inputs. `generated_by` identifies the producing activity
and configuration. Validity bounds mark when a claim applies. A `supersedes`
link records a predecessor and keeps the earlier revision available in history.
The reference store checks revision and predecessor consistency. Applications
validate evidence, authorize access, and enforce review policy before committing.

**Research basis**[W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/){.paper}
models entities and their revisions. It also records activities, agents,
derivation, and responsibility. [Nanopublications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06532){.paper}
attach provenance and metadata to atomic assertions. These results motivate
first-class lineage. Mari uses one generic Python envelope so the same checks
work across artifact types.

## Shared identity and computational inputs

`artifact.ref` is a scoped `RevisionRef`, shared with source resolution,
[evidence validation](../govern/evidence.md), and retrieval.
Prefer structural references in `derived_from` and `supersedes` for new code.
Legacy string references remain accepted for compatibility.

`artifact.derivation_spec(inputs=...)` connects its producing activity to the
[dependency planner](../start/dependency-updates.md). Declare every consumed
input, including collection membership, model settings, or policy state where
relevant. Evidence citations establish lineage. Computational dependencies
also capture inputs that influence output selection and formatting.

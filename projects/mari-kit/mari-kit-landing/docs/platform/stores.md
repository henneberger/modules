# Storage protocols

## Required semantics

| Required semantic | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Compare-and-swap revision | Prevent stale writers from silently winning |
| Tenant-and-space-scoped reads | Keep stored revisions inside their isolation boundary |
| Immutable history | Reconstruct what was known at a prior time |
| Disposable indexes | Rebuild derived state from canonical artifacts |

The included store defines reference semantics. Measure production database
adapters for throughput and verify the same behavior.


:::{collapse} Compare-and-swap examples

| Current revision | Expected revision | Mutation result |
|---|---|---|
| None | None | Initial commit succeeds |
| `r1` | `r1` | Update to `r2` succeeds |
| `r2` | `r1` | `RevisionConflict` |
| Tenant A artifact | Tenant B scope | Hidden by scope filter |

`DocumentStore` and `ArtifactStore` specify observable behavior.
`InMemoryDocumentStore` and `InMemoryArtifactStore` implement the reference
semantics. Store keys include tenant, space, and structural object identity.
Artifact history supports point-in-time reads by `recorded_at`, independent of
commit order.

## How it works

Protocols specify behavior that callers can observe. Each implementation
declares compare-and-swap, history, point-in-time reads, and scope isolation
through `StoreCapabilities`. Cross-store operations use an
application transaction or outbox boundary. Each database keeps its own commit
semantics. Indexes remain disposable projections built from documents and
artifacts.

**Research basis**[Invariant confluence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2237){.paper}
shows that safe coordination depends on application invariants. Mari specifies
atomicity and replay through observable behavior. Isolation, time travel, and
deletion each have explicit capability fields. The protocol split is a Mari
library design.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Compare-and-swap revisions with explicit lineage

from mark_kit.platform import InMemoryArtifactStore, RevisionConflict
from mark_kit.testing import assert_artifact_store_conforms

store = InMemoryArtifactStore()
store.commit(first_revision, expected_revision=None)

try:
    store.commit(second_revision, expected_revision="stale-revision")
except RevisionConflict:
    refresh_and_retry()

current = store.get("fact:refund-window", scope=scope)
historical = store.at_time(
    "fact:refund-window",
    scope=scope,
    known_at=query_time,
)

# Run this same suite against a production adapter factory.
assert_artifact_store_conforms(InMemoryArtifactStore)
```

`InMemoryArtifactStore` rejects duplicate artifact revisions and uses deterministic ordering.
It provides point-in-time reads, tenant-and-space isolation, and atomic revision
checks. `assert_document_store_conforms` and `assert_artifact_store_conforms`
exercise the public adapter contract.

For a retry after an uncertain commit, read the current revision and reconcile
it with the attempted write before issuing another commit. Subsequent artifact
revisions must explicitly supersede the current revision. Authorization and
[evidence validation](../govern/evidence.md) remain application checks.

When persisting [dependency receipts](../start/dependency-updates.md), commit
the output and receipt atomically against the input snapshot. Remove a receipt
when its reusable output is evicted. A receipt is a record of available completed
work, so output availability is part of the storage contract.

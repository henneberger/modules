# Evaluation and compilation

## Measured configuration search

| SciFact configuration search | nDCG@10 |
|---|---:|
| Selected configuration on development split | `0.639` |
| Selected configuration on held-out split | `0.683` |
| Default BM25 on the same held-out split | `0.695` |
| Held-out change | `-0.011` |

The selected configuration overfit this nine-candidate search.
The study records development and held-out results separately.
`compile_configurations` records metrics returned by its evaluator. Reserve
held-out cases for a separate evaluation after selection. Keep the current configuration
when its held-out score remains higher.

:::{collapse} Configuration selection example

| Candidate | Grounded recall | ACL leakage | p95 latency | Decision |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| A | 0.88 | 0.00 | 120 ms | Feasible |
| B | 0.92 | 0.01 | 90 ms | Rejected by ACL constraint |
| C | 0.84 | 0.00 | 70 ms | Rejected by recall minimum |

Weighted utility is computed for candidates that satisfy every constraint.

`compile_configurations` searches caller-supplied pipeline and retrieval configurations against knowledge-system objectives and returns the highest-utility feasible candidate with every trial visible.

## How it works

Declare the tunable parameters and hard constraints. Add metrics used for
selection. The callback evaluates each distinct configuration once. Use the
same frozen development cases for every callback invocation. Constraint
failures remove a candidate from selection. Feasible candidates receive a
weighted utility score. Run the selected candidate once on held-out cases.
Compilation returns the winner and all candidate metrics. Held-out evaluation,
caching, and deployment stay in application code.

Metric weights operate on raw values. Normalize scales or choose weights
explicitly so latency units have the intended influence. Missing objective
metrics, nonfinite values, and a search with zero feasible candidates raise
`ValueError`. Preserve the active configuration when selection fails.

**Research basis**[DSPy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03714){.paper} compiles parameterized LM pipelines against a declared metric. Mari generalizes the search space to retrieval, indexing, parsing, graph, consolidation, and packing configuration. Hard provenance, update-fidelity, and ACL constraints are Mari requirements and must be evaluated independently.

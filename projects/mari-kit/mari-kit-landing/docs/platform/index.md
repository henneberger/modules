# Platform

## Components


| Platform object | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `KnowledgeArtifact[T]` | Shared identity, scope, lineage, review, and time |
| Composition protocols | Store, index, authorizer, serializer, resolver, and clock boundaries |
| `Pipeline` and `Stage` | Deterministic transforms and complete traces |
| `EvaluationRun` | Pinned corpus, configuration, model, and metrics |
| `compile_configurations` | Constraint-first selection among evaluated configurations |
| Portable bundle | Deterministic records, provenance, tombstones, manifest, and checksums |
| [Dependency planner](../start/dependency-updates.md) | Shared scoped inputs, completed receipts, and selective recomputation |
| [Materialized view](living-views.md) | Compatibility adapter for revision-delta refresh |
| Task comparison | Paired success, compliance, turns, tokens, and tool calls |

:::{collapse} Artifact flow example

| Operation | Observable record |
|---|---|
| Parse source revision | Artifact with `derived_from` lineage |
| Commit with expected revision | New immutable revision or `RevisionConflict` |
| Replay source events | Projection with content-derived build ID |
| Evaluate configuration | Trial metrics, constraint failures, selected candidate |
